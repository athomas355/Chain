The code is structured in such a way that the starting process will have its variable i set to 1, the first child will have it as 2, and each subsequent descendant will have it incremented by 1. Each process, before it exits, prints its descendant index, its PID, its PPID, and the PID of its child. The parent does not execute wait. Therefore, if the parent terminates before its child, the child becomes an orphan. In this case, the child is adopted by a special system process (init) with PID as 1. As a result, some of the processes may indicate their PPID as 1.
